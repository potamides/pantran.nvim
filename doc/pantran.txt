With pantran.nvim, you can use your favorite machine translation engines
without having to leave your favorite editor. It makes use of Neovim’s
|api-floatwin| to implement an asynchronous, interactive machine translation
interface, similar to how most of the various machine translation web font-ends
work. In addition to that, other (non-interactive) modes are also supported
and, if you try hard enough, pantran.nvim can also be used as an API.

==============================================================================
1. Quickstart                                             *pantran-quickstart*

Run the command `:Pantran` to open an interactive translation window and start
typing to get an understanding of how things work. Type `g?` in normal mode or
`i_CTRL-/` in insert mode to open a help buffer with available keybindings.
`:Pantran` also supports command ranges to initialize the translation winodw.
Further, some optional flags for configuration of the translation process are
available. If you plan to translate frequently, the command can also be mapped
to the following recommended keybindings:

Neovim 0.7+

>
    local opts = {noremap = true, silent = true}
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>tr", pantran.motion_translate, opts)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>trr", function() return pantran.motion_translate() .. "_" end, opts)
    vim.keymap.set("x", "<leader>tr", pantran.motion_translate, opts)
<


Neovim 0.6

>
    local opts = {noremap = true, silent = true}
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<leader>tr", [[luaeval("require('pantran').motion_translate()")]], opts)
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<leader>trr", [[luaeval("require('pantran').motion_translate() .. '_'")]], opts)
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("x", "<leader>tr", [[luaeval("require('pantran').motion_translate()")]], opts)
<


The mappings work similarly to the command in that they also allow you to use
ranges. E.g., you can use `3<leader>trr` to populate the translation window
with the next three lines of text. One advantage over the command, however, is
the additional support for |text objects|. You can use `<leader>tris` or
`<leader>trip` to translate the surrounding sentence or paragraph, for example.
Other translation modes like replacing or appending text immediately without
opening an interactive window are also implemented.

==============================================================================
2. Scope                                                       *pantran-scope*

The plugin already supports a few different translation engines. If you have
any further suggestions feel free to open an issue
<https://github.com/potamides/pantran.nvim/issues> or pull request
<https://github.com/potamides/pantran.nvim/pulls>! The currently supported
engines are as follows:


- Apertium <https://apertium.org>
- Argos Translate <https://translate.argosopentech.com>
- DeepL <https://www.deepl.com/translator>
- Google Translate <https://translate.google.com>
- Yandex Translate <https://translate.yandex.com>


Some of these engines are free and open-source and can be used right off the
bat. However, some are commercial and might require additional setup steps. For
stability reasons, the philosophy of this plugin is to prioritize official API
endpoints for which commercial engines usually require some means of
authentication, e.g., through an API key. If no such key is configured but free
alternative endpoints exist, these are used as fallback options. Note, however,
that these are often severely rate-limited
<https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell/issues/370> and in some instances
produce inferior translations
<https://github.com/Animenosekai/translate/issues/22>. So if you want to use a
commercial engine, configuring authentication is usually recommended.

3. Usage                                                       *pantran-usage*

        when the width calculated with `width_percentage` is smaller. Defaults to `40`.
    - `scrollbind`: Configures if the translation window should scroll with the input
        window or not. Defaults to `true`.
- `select`: Table which configures the selection mode, i.e., when selecting
    another language or engine. It accepts the following keys:
    - `prompt_prefix`: Prefix string used right before the input field for filtering
        matches. Defaults to `"> "`.
    - `selection_caret`: Prefix string used before the currently selected element in
        the selection window. Defaults to `"► "`.
- `window`: Table with configuration options for individual floating windows of
    the user interface. It accepts the following keys:
    - `title_border`: Table with two elements that are used to decorate left and
        right sides of the window title. Defaults to `{"┤ ", " ├"}`.

          colorcolumn    = "",
          fillchars      = "eob: ",
          winhighlight   = "Normal:PantranNormal,SignColumn:PantranNormal,FloatBorder:PantranBorder",
          textwidth      = 0
        }
    <
- `engines`: Table with configuration options for individual engines. It accepts
    the following keys:
    - `apertium`: See |pantran-apertium|.
    - `argos`: See |pantran-argos-translate|.
    - `deepl`: See |pantran-deepl|.
    - `google`: See |pantran-google-translate|.
    - `yandex`: See |pantran-yandex-translate|.
- `controls`: Table with keybindings and other configuration options that are
    directly influenced by them. Accepts the following keys:
    - `updatetime`: Milliseconds to wait for user input. If the user doesn’t type
        anything in the specified time frame then the current input text is translated
        automatically and displayed in the translation window. Defaults to `300`.
    - `mappings`: Table for configuration of keybindings. This is a nested table
        structure. It can contain the keys `edit` and `select` which configure the
        keybindings used in the main translation window and during the selection mode.
        Each of these two tables can contain the keys `i` and `n` for setting insert
        and normal mode bindings. The key should be the actual binding and the value
        the action to perform. This can either be a function, a string, or `false` to
        disable an existing keybinding. Visit |pantran-default-mappings| for additional
        information.


                                                            *pantran-:Pantran*

:[range]Pantran {args}                 Command for running a translation.


It supports various arguments which are expected to be in the `<key>=<value>`
format. Tab completion is also implemented. When a range is used then the
corresponding text is used to initialize the input in the translation window.
The following parameters are supported:


- `mode`: The translation mode to use instead of the default mode. Consult for
    |pantran-pantran.setup()| for a list of possible values.
- `engine`: The initial engine to use instead of the default engine. Consult for
    |pantran-pantran.setup()| for a list of possible values.
- `source`: The initial source language to use for this translation. Allowed
    values depend on the engine, see |pantran-engines| for details.
- `target`: The initial target language to use for this translation. Allowed
    values depend on the engine, see |pantran-engines| for details.


                                          *pantran-pantran.motion_translate()*

pantran.motion_translate({opts})       Function to use in keybindings for
                                       translations.


This function is useful for keyboard mappings, as it supports both ranges and
motions. Which is helpful to quickly translate a piece of text. `opts` is a
table which supports the same keys and values as |pantran-:pantran|.

                                           *pantran-pantran.range_translate()*

pantran.range_translate({opts})        The function used internally by the
                                       command |pantran-:pantran|.


The previous function |pantran-pantran.motion_translate()| is probably the best
choice for mappings, as this function does not support motions. But in some
cases this might be more useful (e.g., when for your own custom commands). The
allowed arguments are the same.

==============================================================================
4. Engines                                                   *pantran-engines*

Information about supported translation engines and their configuration.
Engines which are not properly configured (e.g., missing API keys) are disabled
automatically and can’t be used. If there are fallback modes available which
do not require authentication then these are used instead. Also note, that most
engines split their input on newlines before attempting translation. If you do
not want that it is advisable to put all coherent input text on one line. You
could then use |gj| and |gk| to move over wrapped lines. Default languages are
configured on a per-engine basis and valid identifiers might vary from engine
to engine. You can list valid identifiers with the following command (this
examples uses `argos`):

>
    :lua async.run(function() print(vim.inspect(engines.argos:languages())) end)
<


Other available configuration options usually reflect what the API endpoints
have to offer and are therefore different from engine to engine.

APERTIUM                                                    *pantran-apertium*

Apertium is a FOSS rule-based machine translation system and can be used right
away. For |pantran-pantran.setup()| it supports the following configuration
keys:


- `default_source`: Primary source language to use for translation. Default value
    is `"auto"`.
- `default_target`: Primary target language to use for translation. Default value
    is `"eng"`.
- `fallback_source`: Apertium is a little bit quirky and sometimes the language
    detection endpoint returns wrong languages that it also can’t translate. In
    these cases this language is used as a fallback. Default is `"deu"`.
- `url`: URL of the Apertium instance to use. Defaults to
    `"https://beta.apertium.org/apy"`.
- `markUnknown`: If `"yes"`, uses `*` to mark unknown words. Default value is
    `"no"`.
- `format`: Text format of the translation input. Can be one of `"html"`,
    `"txt"`, and `"rtf"`. Default value is `"txt"`.


ARGOS TRANSLATE                                      *pantran-argos-translate*

Argos Translate is an open-source (offline) machine translation library. The
web-app and API built on top of it is called LibreTranslate. For
|pantran-pantran.setup()| it supports the following configuration keys:


- `default_source`: Primary source language to use for translation. Default value
    is `"auto"`.
- `default_target`: Primary target language to use for translation. Default value
    is `"en"`.
- `url`: URL of the Argos Translate instance to use. Defaults to
    `"https://translate.argosopentech.com"`.
- `api_key`: Some Argos Translate instances require an API key to control
    traffic. The configured default instance does not, so you don’t need to set
    it. If you change the instance, however, you might also need to configure an
    API key. Defaults to `vim.NIL`.


DEEPL                                                          *pantran-deepl*

DeepL is a commercial and proprietary neural machine translation service. For
programmatic access, the DeepL API requires an API key. Without it this engine
can’t be used and it is therefore deactivated. Note that a free API plan is
available. For |pantran-pantran.setup()| it supports the following
configuration keys:


- `default_source`: Primary source language to use for translation. Default value
    is `vim.NIL` (i.e., when unset the API will attempt to detect the language
    automatically).
- `default_target`: Primary target language to use for translation. Default value
    is `"EN-US"`.
- `auth_key`: The API key to use for this engine. Defaults to
    `vim.env.DEEPL_AUTH_KEY` (i.e., an environment variable).
- `free_api`: Boolean which specifies whether the API key is for the DeepL API
    Free or DeepL API Pro plan. Defaults to `true`.
- `split_sentences`: Sets whether the translation engine should first split the
    input into sentences. Possible values are `0`, `1` (default), and `nonewlines`.
- `preserve_formatting`: Sets whether the translation engine should respect the
    original formatting, even if it would usually correct some aspects. Possible
    values are `0` (default), and `1`.
- `formality`: Sets whether the translated text should lean towards formal or
    informal language. Possible values are `"default"` (default), `"more"`, and
    `"less"`.


GOOGLE TRANSLATE                                    *pantran-google-translate*

Google Translate is a machine translation service deployed by Google. The
implemented default endpoint uses the Google Translate v2/Basic API, for which
you need to authenticate with a Bearer token or API key for your account. If
this is not set up, this plugin falls back to unofficial endpoints used
internally by the web front-ends for Google Translate. Since these endpoints
are not supported by Google and are also rate-limited, setting up
authentication is recommended. For |pantran-pantran.setup()| the primary
endpoint supports the following configuration keys:


- `default_source`: Primary source language to use for translation. Default value
    is `vim.NIL` (i.e., when unset the API will attempt to detect the language
    automatically).
- `default_target`: Primary target language to use for translation. Default value
    is `"en"`.
- `bearer_token`: The token to use for this engine. Defaults to
    `vim.env.GOOGLE_BEARER_TOKEN` (i.e., an environment variable).
- `api_key`: It is also possible to create an API key for authentication. Since
    API keys do not expire (unlike Bearer tokens) this authentication method is
    simpler. This has precedence over `bearer_token`. Defaults to
    `vim.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY` (i.e., an environment variable).
- `format`: Format of the text. Possible values are `"text"` (default) and
    `"html"`.
- `fallback`: Table with configuration options for the fallback endpoint. It
    accepts the following keys:
    - `default_source`: Primary source language to use for translation. Default value
        is `"auto"`.
    - `default_target`: Primary target language to use for translation. Default value
        is `"en"`.


YANDEX TRANSLATE                                    *pantran-yandex-translate*

Yandex Translate is a web service provided by Yandex for machine translation.
The default endpoint uses the Yandex Translate v2 API, for which you need to
authenticate with an IAM token or API key for your account. If you do not have
an account this plugin falls back to the old Yandex Translate v1 API which
works without authentication. Note, however that this endpoint is deprecated
and thus might stop working any time. For |pantran-pantran.setup()| the primary
v2 endpoint supports the following configuration keys:


- `default_source`: Primary source language to use for translation. Default value
    is `vim.NIL` (i.e., when unset the API will attempt to detect the language
    automatically).
- `default_target`: Primary target language to use for translation. Default value
    is `"en"`.
- `iam_token`: The token to use for this engine. Defaults to
    `vim.env.YANDEX_IAM_TOKEN` (i.e., an environment variable).
- `api_key`: Service accounts can also use an API key for authentication. Since
    API keys do not expire (unlike IAM tokens) this authentication method is
    simpler. This has precedence over `iam_token`. Defaults to
    `vim.env.YANDEX_API_KEY` (i.e., an environment variable).
- `folder_id`: A folder is an isolated space where Yandex Cloud resources are
    created and grouped. Setting this is only required for user accounts. Defaults
    to `vim.env.YANDEX_FOLDER_ID` (i.e., an environment variable).
- `format`: Format of the text. Possible values are `"PLAIN_TEXT"` (default) and
    `"HTML"`.
- `fallback`: Table with configuration options for the fallback v1 endpoint. It
    accepts the following keys:
    - `default_source`: Primary source language to use for translation. Default value
        is `"auto"`.
    - `default_target`: Primary target language to use for translation. Default value
        is `"en"`.


==============================================================================
5. Default Mappings                                 *pantran-default-mappings*

Default keybindings for various modes in the interactive translation UI. If not
otherwise specified actions live in the `actions` module. Replace actions
replace the text with which the translation window was initialized (e.g.,
through a range or a movement). Note that `<C-_>` is the key from pressing
`<C-/>`.

6. Highlight Groups                                 *pantran-highlight-groups*

Pantran.nvim defines and uses some highlight groups to bring color to its UI.
Advanced users can overwrite them to their liking. Run `:echo
getcompletion('Pantran', 'highlight')` to see which highlight groups are used.

7. Programmatical Usage                         *pantran-programmatical-usage*

Pantran.nvim can also be used as an API in your own scripts. Note, however,
that this is highly experimental as it requires access to internal APIs which
are subject to change.

>
    local function translate(sentence)
      -- Engine methods can throw errors (e.g., due to timeouts or other network
      -- errors), which is why we use pcall.
      local ok, translation = pcall(engines.argos.translate, sentence)
      if ok then
        print(translation.text)
      end
    end
    
    async.run(translate, "Hallo Welt!") -- prints "Hello World!"
